    <p>Kwame Nkrumah PC (21 September
         1909[1][a] – 27 April 1972) was a Ghanaian politician, political theorist, and revolutionary. He was the first Prime Minister and President of Ghana, having led the Gold Coast to independence from Britain in 1957.[2] An influential advocate of Pan-Africanism, Nkrumah was a founding member of the Organization of African Unity and winner
          of the Lenin Peace Prize from the Soviet Union in 1962.[3]
    After twelve years abroad pursuing higher education, 
    developing his political philosophy, 
    and organizing with other diasporic pan-Africanists,
     Nkrumah returned to the Gold Coast to begin his political 
     career as an advocate of national independence.[4] He formed the 
     Convention People's Party, which achieved rapid success through its 
     unprecedented appeal to the common voter.[5]
      He became Prime Minister in 1952 and retained the position when
       Ghana declared independence from Britain in 1957. In 1960,
     Ghanaians approved a new constitution and elected Nkrumah President.[6]</p>
